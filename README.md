# voice-to-text
This project uses deep learning technologies to transfer voice to text. It is build with pytorch and based on the [cs224n-2019/assignment 5](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/). The technologies used in the project include 1Dconv, embedding, highway LSTM, Attention, beam search. The project uses [LJ-Speech-Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) to train and validate the model.
